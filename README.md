This project was developed as the final project for an advanced programming course👨‍💻🥇. The primary goal was to create a user interface that is both visually appealing and feature-rich, closely resembling the functionality and design of YouTube. The project showcases a variety of advanced programming techniques and tools to deliver a seamless user experience.
